## Introduction

-   Public Health - Science *vs.* Advocacy
-   The need for participatory decision making in public health
-   The transparency of open data science approach
-   The beauty of computational reports, presentations, etc.

## Work plan

## Lectures

-   Essential concepts
-   Mainly to get the big picture
-   Enthusing interest rather than teaching
-   Welcome to the open data science initiative!

## Lab work

-   Do it yourself
-   Get skilled in the process
-   Come out of your comfort zones and collaborate!
-   Use data for dialogue!

## What information does GIS use?

-   Data that defines geographical features like roads, rivers

-   Soil types, land use, elevation

-   Demographics, socioeconomic attributes

-   Environmental, climate, air-quality

-   Annotations that label features and places

## What is Spatial Data Science?

## Spatial Data Science

-   **Analyse** and **extract** insights from geospatial data
-   Work with **real-world data** on a number of domains and problems
-   Acquire key **data science skills** and important tools to answer spatial questions

## Skills for public health data science

**Hard Skills** - Programming Language - Transparency and Reproducibility - Version control

**Soft Skills** - Communication - Storytelling - Geospatial analytics acumen - Ethical skills

## R software for Spatial Data Science (SDS)

**Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**

-   QGIS and GRASS has revolutionized Open source Spatial Information Systems (GIS).
-   However, the reproducibility aspect has many challenges

**Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)**

Command Line Interface (CLIs) of R software is a good way to bring in reproducible algorithms for GIS/SDS

## The Spatial Data 'Revolution’

**Advanced Hardware**: High-performance computer hardware and efficient algorithms allow us to process vast data sets quickly.

**Scalable Software**: Scalable solutions with the R environment help us to sift through the data deluge, and extract valuable insights from the noise.

**Spatial Databases**: The advent of spatial databases empowers us to store and manipulate manageable subsets within the vast ocean of spatial data.

## SDS in Public Health

-   **Data Science**:"gathering data messaging it into a tractable form, making it tell its story and presenting that story to others"

<br>

Loukides (2011) What is Data Science?

## Traditional datasets in healthcare

-   Collected for the purpose (carefully designed)
-   Detailed and informative ("rich profile and portraits of the country")
-   High quality

## Traditional health and allied sector data

-   Massive enterprises (very costly)
-   Coarse in resolution (to preserve privacy they need to be aggregated)
-   Slow - the more detailed, the less frequent they are available

## Examples

-   Decennial census (census geographies)
-   Longitudinal surveys
-   Custom collected surveys, interviews etc.
-   Economic or well-being indicators

## *New Forms* of spatial data

Tied into the geo-data revolution

-   Accidental : created for different purposes but available for analysis as a side effect

-   Very diverse in nature: resolution and quality but, potentially much more detailed in both space and time

## Challenges (Arribas-Bel, 2014)

-   Bias
-   Technical barriers
-   Methodological "mismatch"

## Part 2

## (Geo)visualisation

By encoding information visually, they allow to present large amounts of numbers in a meaningful way.

## A map for everyone

**A real public health tool**

Maps can fulfill several needs, looking very different depending on the end-goal.

**MacEachren & Kraak (1997)** identify three main dimensions:

-   Knowledge of what is being plotted
-   Target audience
-   Degree of interactivity

## MacEachren & Kraak (1997)

## DiBiase’s (1990) “Swoopy”

Translating numbers into a (visual) language that the human brain "speaks better"

## Exploratory Visualization

<br>

"forces us to notice what we never expected to see" (Tukey 1977: vi)

<br>

-   Mostly for ourselves in the course of the research process.

-   Many, quick and dirty, and rather unattractive graphs.

## Explanatory Visualization

<br>

"forces readers to see the information the designer wanted to convey" (Kosslyn 1994: 271)

<br>

-   Mostly for others after the research is completed.

-   Few, carefully crafted, and attractive graphs.

## Choropleths

*Thematic map in which values of a variable are encoded using a color gradient of some sort*

-   Counterpart of the histogram

    **Both allows us to gage the distribution of a variable**

## Part 3

## **Spatial Weights**

For a statistical method to be explicitly spatial, it needs to contain some representation of the geography, or spatial context. One of the most common ways is through **Spatial Weights Matrices**

-   (Geo)Visualization: translating numbers into a (visual) language (colors) that the human brain can interpret.
-   Spatial Weights Matrices: translating geography into a (numerical) language that a computer can interpret.

## Spatial Weight Matrices

Spatial Weights Matrices are building block for spatial analysis and statistics.

They are used to assign a weighted average or sum of neighbouring data values to an observation, or other point in space.

-   Relates to concepts of spatial ‘smoothing’ and interpolating data

-   They can be used to see how one's characteristics or outcomes is correlated with their neighbours: e.g. education, criminality, disease risk factors,...

## Core element in several spatial analysis techniques

-   Spatial autocorrelation
-   Spatial clustering/geo-demographics
-   Spatial regression

## Spatial Weights

Spatial Weights represented by $$W$$ N x N positive matrix that contains spatial relations that are translated into values

-   If you are not a neighbour, $value = 0$
-   If you are a neighbour, $value<0$
