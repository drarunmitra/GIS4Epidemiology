## Introduction
::: columns
::: column
- **Infectious diseases** can be transmitted:
  - **Directly** (e.g., influenza)
  - **Indirectly** (e.g., through water, soil)
- **Spatial dimensions** are crucial for understanding and managing diseases.
- Advancements in **computing and statistical methods** enhance disease visualization and analysis.

## Spatial Data Types
- **Point Data**: 
  - Raw data such as incidences, deaths, physical locations (e.g., hospitals)
- **Aggregate Data**: 
  - Summaries of individual points like incidence rates by area

::: notes
- **Point Data** provides detailed and precise information, allowing for pinpointing specific outbreak locations.
- **Aggregate Data** helps in understanding broader trends but can obscure local variations.

## Disease Mapping Techniques
### Location Mapping
- Historical examples:
  - Yellow fever in New York (1798)
  - Cholera in London (1854)
- **Advantages**: Quick observation of disease spread.
- **Limitations**: Privacy issues, difficulty in reflecting population distributions.

### Surface Mapping
- **Choropleth Maps**:
  - Example: Filariasis in India, Q fever in the Netherlands.
- **Advantages**: Visualize incidence rates clearly.
- **Limitations**: May hide demographic factors, sensitive to spatial scales.

## Advanced Mapping Techniques
::: columns
::: column
### Bayesian Smoothing
- Reduces bias in local risk estimation.
- **Example**: Applied in studies of dengue, influenza, and tuberculosis.

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Identifies dense points and visualizes as smooth surfaces.
- **Example**: Dengue cases in Delhi.

## Overall Spatial Patterns
### Clustering Methods
- **Nearest Neighbour Ratio**:
  - Assesses clustering degree (e.g., rabies in China).
- **Ripley’s K Function**:
  - Measures spatial clustering over distance (e.g., leishmaniasis in Brazil).

*Figure 5: Visualization of clustering methods.*

::: notes
- Clustering methods help identify hotspots and inform targeted interventions.

## Statistical Tests for Clustering
###  Point Data
- **Nearest Neighbour Ratio**
- **Cuzick and Edwards’ test**
- **Ripley’s K function**

###  Aggregate Data
- **Spatial autocorrelation statistics** (e.g., Moran’s I)

::: notes
- These tests are crucial for confirming whether observed patterns are statistically significant.
:::


## Hot Spot Detection
###  Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)
- Identifies clusters of high or low values.

###  Spatial Scan Statistics
- Detects clusters in space and time (e.g., leishmaniasis in Brazil).

*Figure 6: Example of hot spot detection using LISA and spatial scan statistics.*


##  Identifying Risk Factors
###  Neighbourhood Effect
- Disease risk influenced by nearby cases.

###  Spatial Heterogeneity
- Variation in disease risk across different areas.

###  Spatial Regression Methods
- Adjust for neighbourhood effects and spatial heterogeneity.

##  Conclusion
- **Spatial epidemiology** provides insights into the spread and control of infectious diseases.
- **Future Directions**: Enhancing GPS methods, optimizing Bayesian estimations.
- **Key Impact**: Improved disease surveillance, hypothesis generation, and strategic control measures.
