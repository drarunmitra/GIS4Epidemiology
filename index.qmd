# Welcome

  - Welcome to the Day 2 of **Geospatial Technology for Public Health Policy** Workshop!
  - The goal for today is to highlight the applications of GIS in Epidemiology while providing the foundational concepts in Spatial Epidemiology. 
  - The workshop introduces the participants to the field of Spatial Data Science through the statistical programming language R.
  - The workshop is intended as an introductory window into the world of spatial data analysis and visualization for public health policy.
  - Workshop materials in the github repository [GIS4EPI-Workshop](https://github.com/drarunmitra/GIS4Epidemiology)

## Learning Objectives for the Workshop

At the end of the day, participants will be able to:

- Understand and Apply Foundational Concepts in Spatial Epidemiology
- Utilize Tools and Techniques for Spatial Data Analysis and Spatial Data Science
- Implement Best Practices for Reproducible Spatial Data Research and Analysis
- Analyze and Interpret Spatial Data for Public Health Applications
- Explore the applications of spatial epidemiology in public health research and practice
- Gain hands-on experience with spatial data analysis and visualization
